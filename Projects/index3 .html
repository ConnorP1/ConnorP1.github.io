    <div class="intro">
      This discussion covers everything from fascinations with geometry to daily
      routines. We hope you enjoy!
    </div>

    <div class="q1">
      Lets jump right into this, starting off, where were you born/from?
    </div>
    <div class="r1">
      I was born in NYC and lived in Brooklyn till I was around 4. Then we moved
      to Jersey and that's where I was pretty much raised. Now I live in
      Brooklyn again though.
    </div>
    <div class="q1">
      Cool, what was it like growing up there? What things would you get into?
    </div>
    <div class="r1">
      It was nice overall. New Jersey tends to carry a rather negative stigma to
      it when brought up in conversation. Some of it is warranted haha, but I
      think there's alot of cool aspects about the place. Where I was was still
      within arms reach of the city so naturally I was over there as much as
      possible, especially after I started skating. I'm super grateful that I
      kinda had a taste of both. Like, I love being around nature. Being around
      trees, hiking, doing yard work, stuff like that is really important to me.
      And then on the other side of that, I love being in the city. I've met
      some of the people I love most here. It truly can be such a special place.
      I think it's important to have a balance though. Sometimes you need that
      interaction, other times you need to be somewhere quiet and just be with
      yourself.
    </div>

    <div class="q1">
      Definetly. Making an effort to balance both is so necessary. When and how
      did you start skateboarding? We're you always into it?
    </div>
    <div class="r1">
      I was either 9 or 10 when I started. I had a budget 'Toys R Us' skateboard
      that had been in my garage for awhile and had brought it out during a
      family bbq. I remember talking to my friend who I walked home from school
      with about how cool it was and he said his older brother had one. We
      pretty much became best friends after that. We would just skate around the
      neighborhood and watch YouTube videos made by random kids skating in their
      driveways.
    </div>
    <div class="q1">
      Do you think YouTube and the internet in general impacted the things you
      were into as a kid?
    </div>
    <div class="r1">
      Oh absolutely. I was super into YouTube and computers as a whole as a kid.
      I actually played most games using a computer opposed to an Xbox. Looking
      back it was actually kinda cool.
    </div>
    <div class="q1">Oh thats cool. What kinda games were you on?</div>
    <div class="r1">
      Oh man so many things. I was definetly into random online websites like
      Miniclip, but then was definetly into Call of Duty. There were a lot of
      niche ones as well. I had a long period of time where I was really
      obsessed with old Mario games, and any old Nintendo or Atari stuff. There
      was something about the way stuff looked that made it so intriguing. My
      friend and I would find the original Mario games online and recode little
      things, or we'd find these rare extensions for the DS haha. It was cool
      though, all those things made me more aware. I think nerding out on all of
      those things was actually a good thing.
    </div>
    <div class="q1">
      Yeah a lot of older video games have something fascinating about them
      thats hard to explain haha. What other things fascinate you?
    </div>

    <div class="r1">
      Haha everything. I dont know, I guess anything I don't fully understand at
      face value fascinates me. I think math and science are actually so cool.
      I'm not wired like that either, but how geomemtry presents itself in
      nature endlessly amazes me. I think wood and metal working is really cool.
      Tapestry and intricate quilting art is so beautiful. I think dreams are
      fascinating and confusing. Light can be breathtaking and hard to describe.
      Old clothes. Computers. Trucks. I think the early to mid 2000s is a really
      interesting time. This could go on forever if I wanted it to.
    </div>
    <div class="q1">What kind of truck would you want?</div>
    <div class="r1">
      Ohhh, a late 90s/early 2000s Toyota Tacoma or a late 80s Ford F-250.
    </div>
    <div class="q1">
      What does a normal morning look like for you? Lets say if you weren't in a
      rush to get somewhere or do something.
    </div>
    <div class="r1">
      If I don't have to be somewhere its nice to not wake up to an alarm. Put
      on pants but no shirt. I always make coffee. I might play music or a
      podcast. Then when the coffee's ready I make a cup with some almond milk.
      Then I make a smoothie or some oatmeal. Lately I've been into writing
      things down so I'll keep something nearby to write in. Probably check my
      phone. Sometimes if I'm the only one there I'll pace around or dance a
      little.
    </div>
    <div class="q1">What are 3 things you want to get better at?</div>
    <div class="r1">
      Focusing on one thing at a time. Implementing a daily stretching routine.
      Surfing.
    </div>
    <div class="q1">
      Alright. I think we'll end it there. Thanks for this conversation. I wish
      you all the best!
    </div>
    <div class="r1">Likewise! Thank you, take care.</div>
